# Git, Github, and Workflow training: Prerequisites

The documentation for a service you own resides on docs.microsoft.com. Docs.ms uses a collaborative contribution model, where anyone – both within Microsoft and without – can propose changes to the content and submit them for publication. This is made possible through the use of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (an extremely lightweight and intuitive markup language), the open source version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (specifically designed for distributed creation of code and content), and [Github](https://github.com) (a website that stores Git projects online).

In our upcoming training session, we will cover the basics of git, GitHub (a website that enables internet-based access of shared git projects), and our docs.microsoft.com workflow.  To make the best use of our time, please complete the following steps before your session:

1. **[Create a Microsoft-specific Github account](https://github.com/join)**: Even if you already have a personal Github account, you’ll need to set up a Microsoft-specific account. 

2. **[Complete your Github profile](https://github.com/settings/profile)**: Make sure you supply the following:

  - Profile picture: A picture of you (required)
  - Email: your Microsoft email address (required)
  - Company: Microsoft Corporation (required)
  - Location: list your location (required)
  

   Your completed profile should resemble this:

3. **[Enable multifactor authentication for your Github Account](../tools-setup.md#user-content-enable-two-factor-authentication-2fa-and-create-an-access-token)**: Two-factor authentication is required to work in the private Microsoft repositories. You can enable it at https://github.com/settings/security; for more information, see https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/.

4. **[Connect to the Microsoft org](https://opensourcehub.microsoft.com/)**: Visit https://opensourcehub.microsoft.com/, log into you GitHub account, and connect your account to the Microsoft Github org.

5. **[Authorize the OPS build system to access your GitHub account](https://op-portal-prod.azurewebsites.net/#/login)**: Do this by going to https://op-portal-prod.azurewebsites.net/#/login and signing in with your GitHub credentials.

6. **[Install and configure Git tools](../tools-setup.md#install-git-for-windows)**: Training will use the Git Bash commandline shell.

7. **[Install a markdown editor](../tools-setup.md#install-a-markdown-editor)**: We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/code-vs.aspx), although any text- or markdown-editor will suffice. [ATOM](https://atom.io/) is another popular choice in CSI.

8. **Send your github username to your trainer**: Once the trainer has your Github username, you can be given permissions to the Github repositories in which you will be working.

Please let your trainer know if you encounter any problems, so you can troubleshoot technical difficulties without spending training time doing so. 

Lastly, if you’d like to learn more about Git before your session, we would highly recommend the “Learn Git” course on Codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git. It’s interactive, fun, modular (so you can take a few lessons whenever you have the time), and only takes a few hours to complete. You’ll need to create an account to take the course, but Codecademy is a great site, so you’ll be glad you did.

Another good beginner course can be found on Code School: https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git. In fact, GitHub has an entire page of useful resources, including their own [15-minue interactive primer](https://try.github.io/), [cheat sheets](https://training.github.com/kit/), and links to formalized training.
